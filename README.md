# Snapathon!
## Shoot, Compete, Rate, Repeat!
## Code Institute Milestone Project 3

Snapathon seeks to gamify photography. It is a photo-sharing application that enhances the user experience with competition. 

# UX
## User Stories

This application is targeted towards photography enthusiasts. Anyone who takes photographs for fun and loves to share them with others.
Other photo sharing platforms have indicated a massive opportunity for an application that successfully gamifies photography and this application aims to achieve that.
Snapathon aims to entice users to register and upload their images in weekly competitions pitting their best images against others'.

## Application Goals

- Create a workable photography competition application that is fun and intutive to use. 
- Gamify photography (both amateur & professional), and thus encourage high quality imagery as opposed to the current trend of low-quality personal images.
- Make the content publicly accessible / viewable, so as to encourage users to register and use the application. 
- Create a loyal community of users who regularly engage and compete against each other for points and bragging rights. 
- Allow users to easily register and then login and out of the application and have them be able to store and retrieve their data easily.

 # Strategy
 ## Project Goals
As already touched upon, the aim with this project is to create a usable photography competition application that enhances the quality of photography users display on the internet. 
As a professional photographer, I would love to use an application where the emphasis is less on sharing personal images and more on sharing images based on the quality of their photography.
High quality cameras on phones and mobile devices have made photography hugely accessible for people in the last few years. 
However their has been a marked drop in the quality of photography online. 

The main goal for this application is to create an interface and an environment that encourage great quality images. That encourages looking for good light and interesting subjects.

 ## Target users
The target users for this application are anyone who enjoys photography as a pasttime or professionally. There are no restrictions on tools used, a mobile phone camera is just as valid as a high-end dSLR or mirrorless. 
The importance is placed on the image itself, and how much that image speaks to its audience. 

 ## Research / Background to the application
I am a professional photographer, working in many different photographic fields for over a decade and I have a love/hate relationship with online photography competitions. Competitions based on the determination of a "panel of judges" 
can be overly subjective and said panel is usually comprised of the site owner who may or may not have any authority on the matter. I wanted to create a democratic competition where the competitors are also the judges and therefore the final awards are 
as meritocratic as possible. Especially since one of the more innovative aspects of this application is that users will be awarded points not only when their images win, but also if they vote for any of the top 3 placed images. 

In this way, users will be encouraged to actively vote for what they think are the best images, and not selectively based on strategizing. 

Ideally, there will also be a professional photographer offshoot to this application and such determinations would hold even more weight.
