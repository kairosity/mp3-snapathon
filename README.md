Snapathon seeks to gamify photography. It is a photo-sharing application that enhances the user experience with competition. 

# UX
## User Stories

This application is targeted towards photography enthusiasts. Anyone who takes photographs for fun and loves to share them with others.
Other photo sharing platforms have indicated a massive opportunity for an application that successfully gamifies photography and this application aims to achieve that.
Snapathon aims to entice users to register and upload their images in weekly competitions pitting their best images against others'.

## Application Goals

- Create a workable photography competition application that is fun and intutive to use.

- Make the content publicly accessible / viewable, so as to encourage users to register and use the application. 
- Create a loyal community of users who regularly engage and compete against each other for points and bragging rights. 
- Allow users to easily register and then login and out of the application and have them be able to store and retrieve their data easily.
