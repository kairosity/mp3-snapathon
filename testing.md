# Input Validation

## Registration Form

Various validations were employed to ensure the registration form saved the correct inputs to the database. 

1. The 'required' attribute was added to *all* inputs to ensure that no blank fields are returned. 

2. For usernames the 'min-length' attribute was set to 5 and the 'max-length' to 25.

3. For passwords, the 'min-length' attribute was set to 6 and the 'max-length' to 25.

4. For the email input the 'pattern' attribute was employed to use regex to ensure only valid email formats are entered. 

        pattern="^([a-zA-Z0-9_\-\.]+)@([a-zA-Z0-9_\-\.]+)\.([a-zA-Z]{2,5})$"

    This is not a failsafe regex for email, however it will suffice for the first iteration of this application. 

5. On the backend side of things, both usernames and emails are checked against existing data in the database to ensure neither have already been registered. 

6. Also on the backend, the password & password confirmation fields are checked against each other, to ensure they match and to protect against typos.
